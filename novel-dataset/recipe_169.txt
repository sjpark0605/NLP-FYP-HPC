using a vegetable peeler or cheese slicer , shave the parmesan cheese into"ribbons". intertwine a few ribbons of cheese andham on each of 6 chilled plates to form a small , fluffy mound. using a mandoline or sharp knife , slice the pear as thinly as possible. add a few pear slices to each mound of cheese and ham. over each plate , toss a few leaves of baby arugula , sprinkle with pine nuts and drizzle with the extra virgin olive oil. garnish with cracked black pepper. looks and tastes like you slaved all day. who knew it could be so easy !.
