prepare to have the ice water handy by filling a pyrex measuring cup with water and ice cubes. set it by your work area , and let it get icy cold. combine flour and salt in a medium bowl. with a pastry cutter , cut the shortening in until the mixture resembles pea-sized crumbs. take out the pastry cutter and , while stirring with a fork , add 1 tablespoon ice cold water at a time until the dough is sticky and comes together. if the weather is warm / humid , less water will be needed. be sure you have the consistency you want , because it's very difficult to add more water. form half the dough into a ball with your hands , and flatten the ball into a 1 / 2" thickness , rounding the edges. place the dough onto a lightly floured surface , and roll into a 10" circle. gently transfer to a 9" pie plate. gently press the pastry down into the plate , being sure not to stretch or tear the dough. if it does tear a little , just take some off the edge , and "patch" it. create a decorative edge around the top , and cut any extra crust off of the edge. repeat for a second single-crust pie , or fill the bottom crust and top with the second half of this recipe for a double-crust pie. blind bake the crusts or fill and bake as directed in your recipe.
