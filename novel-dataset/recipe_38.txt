in a wide bowl / container , mix coconut flakes , curry powder , garlic powder , paprika. in a small bowl , mix 1 egg , 1 / 4 cup water and 1 / 3 cup of corn starch. dip the tilapia fillets in the egg mixture. use a plastic bag to cover your hands when handling fillets , if preferred. coat the fillets thoroughly with the coconut flake mixture , especially along the top , as this dramatically improves the appearance of the dish while baking. bake the tilapia fillets at 350 degrees for about 12-14 minutes. use cooking spray or butter the pan so the fish does not stick. while the tilapia is baking , make the peanut sauce. mix all of the ingredients listed above. vary ingredient amounts to your liking. cool or set aside until the tilapia is ready. broil the fillets for a few minutes until golden. serve the fillets on a plate and scoop the peanut sauce on the side.
