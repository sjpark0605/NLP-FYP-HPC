cut up the butter into small slices. microwave for 45 seconds. pour into a mixing bowl and let it cool for a minute. with a hand blender , beat the butter. add sugar and beat. add flour and eggs and beat. pull out a cutting board and two butter knives. drop a tbsp onto the pizzelle maker. they cook fast !. put on some plastic gloves. wrap each cookie around the butter knife handle while its still hot. you have to be very quick or your fingers will hurt. the best way to do it is to pull the cookie from the maker with a spatula , place on cutting board. then center the butter knife handle in on the cookie. pull one side of the cookie over the handle and then the other. flip the whole thing over so the knife holds the cookie in shape. do not eat all the cookies before you finish making them ! your family will be upset. the house will smell of them for hours , so there is no escape. cool cookies completely. blend all filling ingredients and fill. feel free to try any other kinds of fillings and you can play with the filling proportions to your taste. refrigerate cookies that are not eaten.
