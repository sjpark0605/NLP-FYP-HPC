slice the courgettes length ways , using a swivel vegetable peeler - you'll need 24 long strips. drizzle some of the olive oil and balsamic over two large plates and lay the strips flat , trying not to overlap. sprinkle with more oil and balsamic. cover and leave to marinate in the fridge for at least 20 minutes. can be prepared up to 6 hrs ahead. mix the ricotta with lemon juice and seasoning to taste. mix in the basil and pine nuts. place 1 tsp of the ricotta mixture onto one end of a courgette strip and roll up. repeat until you have used up all the filling. arrange rolls upright on a plate and grind over some black pepper. drizzle with a little more oil and balsamic vinegar to serve.
