preheat the oven to 350 degrees. line a jelly roll pan with parchment or wax paper. place the saltines neatly in the pan , not overlapping. the pan should hold 40 crackers pretty neatly. i break the last row in half to fit tightly. melt the butter and add the brown sugar. keep on med-hi to hi and stir constantly for 5 minutes exactly. be aware that hot sugar is really fracking hot. don't consider touching it. pour the sugar mixture onto the saltines and spread out over all the crackers. i use a frosting spreader. use a fork to move any wayward crackers back in line. put in in the oven for 3-5 minutes. pull out and let sit for a minute , then empty the bag of chocolate chips all over the top. back in the oven for a minute , then spread out the now melty yumminess. sprinkle some salt on top. this is optional. in some universes , i guess. put it in the freezer for 30 minutes or let it sit out for hours. it's a pretty easy decision for me , really. break up into cracker sized pieces. hide in the closet and eat 10 pieces before letting anyone know you made them.
