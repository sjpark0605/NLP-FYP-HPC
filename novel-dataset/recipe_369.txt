in your salad bowl whisk mustard , salt , pepper , vinegar briskly until very well combined. add the vinegar and whisk for about a minute. add honey and whisk for about 30 seconds. it should be thick. whisk in the shallot and garlic. dribble the olive oil into the base very slowly whisking all the while. the olive oil should be completely incorporated as you dribble. this is important so if you see oil in a ring around the vinegar , keep whisking ! after all of the oil is mixed in , keep whisking for a few seconds more to ensure the emulsification. just before serving add your salad fixings , romaine , carrots , tomatoes , scallions , herbs , what you like. toss and add the walnuts and cheese to the top. serve on chilled plates. i have made this in a punch bowl to serve about 35 people. if you want , you can store the dressing in the refrigerator in a jar for everyday use.
