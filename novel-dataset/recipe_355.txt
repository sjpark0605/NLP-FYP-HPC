dice squash. add eggs and stir until all the squash is coated with egg. next , add flour. just add flour until squash is well coated with an egg and flour batter. in large skillet , fry squash. i usually add pepper , salt , and garlic while my squash is frying. hint: if fixing a large amount i use 2 skillets so the squash fries up a bit crispier.
