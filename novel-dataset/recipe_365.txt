in mid sized sauce pan , put sugar , water , carrots , raisins , butter and spices , bring to boil turn down and simmer five minutes. remove from heat , cover and rest for 12 hours , comment on the recipe "the secret of this cake is to let the boiled ingredients stand for twelve hours" i have always followed this step. then add the baking soda mixing to dissolve , add the flour , salt and baking powder. lastly fold in the nuts. put the batter into two well greased loaf pans or 1 tube pan -- have used the 8 1 / 2 x 4 x 2 1 / 2. one friend makes these for gifts using a number of small sized loaf pans. i would think it depends on the size loaf you are wanting. bake 275 for 2 hours. this may vary from oven to oven. cool and wrap -- i like to leave this one mellow a few days before using. keeps well. yield depends on serving size but should make for 10 to 12 servings.
