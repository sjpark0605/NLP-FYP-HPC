1. add 1. 5c water and spinach to a small pot and bring it to a boil. use the seasoning packet to your liking in this step. 2. add the dry noodles to the pot to cook for 3 minutes total. 3. 2 minutes into the cooking time , slowly incorporate the beaten egg. 4. after the egg has cooked through , take the pot off the burner. serve immediately and garnish with the furikake seasoning. if you are not going to eat ramen right away , separate the broth from the "solid" parts and combine before you serve it so the noodles don't turn to mush.
