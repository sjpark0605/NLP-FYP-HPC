cook the macaroni as per pkg. instructions. drain. squeeze the cheese sauce on the macaroni and mix well. i did not add any margarine , just the cheese sauce. when well mixed , add the green beans and mix well again. open the can of spam and grate it. then , add it to the macaroni / green bean mixture and mix well. if you choose not to use the diced tomatos , you are ready to eat. if you choose to use the tomatoes , add them and mix them gently inches at this point , you can either put it in a casserole dish , and pour two beaten eggs over it , then top it with a layer of spaghetti sauce and bake it until the eggs are done and its hot and bubbly or you can just eat it the way it is sprinkled with salt and pepper. either way , i think ist yummy. it is even better the next day heated up in the microwave. but , i warn you , if you don't like spam , you won't like this !.
