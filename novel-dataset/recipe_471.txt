preheat oven to 350f. crumble graham crackers and rice krispies in a food chopper or food processor and whisk around until you have fine crumbs. mix the graham mix and the remaining bottom layer ingredients together to form soft dough. i do this with a wooden spoon or bare hands. there is no need to get out a mixer for this. firmly press the dough into a 9x13 pan. completely cover the bottom of the pan in an even layer. do not use a larger pan. you can use a smaller baking pan for a thicker bar. mix all the top layer ingredients together , except the blueberries , mixing well. a wire whisk works well. again , don't bother to get a mixer out. gently mix in the blueberries. pour the top layer mixture in the pan over the bottom layer. make sure the blueberries are spread out evenly. bake for 50-60 minutes. chill completely before cutting and serving. although it is difficult to wait so long , chilling overnight will give the custard plenty of time to set.
