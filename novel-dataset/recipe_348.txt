use a 6-quart slow cooker. unwrap the ham , and discard the flavor packet. place the ham into your insert. in a small mixing bowl , combine the honey , mustard , ginger , cloves , and cinnamon. smear this paste evenly all over the ham. you can even do this the day before , if you'd like , to let the flavors meld , although it isn't necessary. pour the juice and add the last little bit with the pulp into the sauce bowl and swirl it around to get all of the "good stuff" out of the bowl. pour ginger ale evenly over the top. cover , and cook on low for 6-8 hours , or on high for about 3 hours. your ham can sit in the slow cooker for quite a while on the warm setting before carving , or you can take it out , carve it into pieces , then return it to the pot to stay warm in the yummy sauce until you and your guests are ready to eat.
