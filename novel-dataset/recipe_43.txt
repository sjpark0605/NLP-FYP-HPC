1. preheat the oven to 450 degrees. in a large skillet , heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. add the onion and cook , stirring often , until softened , about 5 minutes. add the mushrooms and cook , stirring occasionally , until they've released and absorbed most of their juices , about 5 minutes. 2. in a large bowl , combine the tuna and mayo , breaking up the tuna. stir in the onion-mushroom mixture , then stir in two-thirds of the cheese. 3. in a small bowl , whisk together the milk , eggs , flour and butter. stir in the tuna mixture. transfer to a 10" deep-dish pie pan and bake until browned , about 35 minutes. top with remaining cheese and broil until the cheese has melted. one thing i would add is a thinly sliced layer of tomatoes on top , then top that with the remaining cheddar cheese. it just doesn't seem like a tuna melt without the tomatoes !.
