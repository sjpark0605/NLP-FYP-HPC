method:. put flour , butter and salt into into the food processor , put lid on and turn on the machine. pour the water through the feeder spout in a stream. let blades rotate until the mixture turns into a ball of dough. let this sit out for a while as it makes the dough easier to work with. filling method:. cook the potatoes , mash , add the cheese and mix well until cheese has melted into the potatoes. let them cool a little before filling the pierogies as this will make them easier to handle. next roll out your peirogie dough with a rolling pin. use a glass or round cookie cutter to make your circles. it might be a good idea to dip whatever you use into flour to prevent it from sticking. place filling on the circle , don't over fill and seal the edges well. if this leaks you lose your filling in the water. place the made peirogies on a floured surface and don't let the peirogies touch , they will stick together. drop the peirogies into the pot of boiling water and cook for 5-8 minutes or until they rise to the surface of the water. this means they are cooked. boil about 6-10 at a time as this won't cool your boiling water down too much. melt some butter and put in the bottom of an oven safe dish. i use a 9x13 ceramic dish. i layer the pierogies with fried onions and turkey bacon. you can use regular bacon. the onion and bacon can be fried up ahead of time. i use a whole onion and 8 pieces of bacon cut up small. bon appetit.
