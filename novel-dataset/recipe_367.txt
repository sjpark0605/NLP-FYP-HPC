preheat oven to 325f. in a large bowl , cream together butter and sugar until light. beat in egg and extracts. add flour and salt to the bowl and mix them into the butter-sugar mixture at low speed until dough is just combined. wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. divide dough in half and keep the portion you are not using in the refrigerator. roll dough out on a lightly floured surface until it is about 1 / 8-inch thick. use a cookie cutter to cut out 2-inch rounds. place rounds on a baking sheet , put a teaspoon of jam on each of them and cover with another round of dough. press edges down lightly , pinching the edges onto the cookie sheet. use a toothpick and poke two small holes in the top of each cookie. bake for 10-12 minutes , until cookies are set. cool for about 5 minutes on the baking sheet , then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. dip a toothpick in some extra red jam and re-insert in the bite holes you made before baking to emphasize them , if not already red. draw a blood trickle down from one of the bites with the jam , if desired. cookies are best the day they are made.
