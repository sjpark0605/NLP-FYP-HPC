preheat oven to 350 degrees f. in a 13"x9" baking dish , evenly distribute pears , the juice or syrup they were packed in , and the banana slices. pour the dry cake mix over the fruit , making it as even as possible and slightly packing it down. thinly slice the butter into pats and dot the top of the cake mix with them. bake at 350f for 40 minutes. cool for 20 minutes , so you don't burn your mouth ! this tastes especially good with ice cream or vanilla yoghurt.
