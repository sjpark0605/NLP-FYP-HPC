trim silver skin and as much fat as possible from the tenderloins. the first thing makes it more tender , the second thing makes it healthier. whip egg whites until frothy , then add a good quality mustard to the mixture and beat until well blended. on one side of the bowl with whipped egg whites , have flour mixed with salt and pepper. on the other side of the egg bowl , have mixture of half coarsely chopped pecans and plain bread crumbs. just beyond the tray that has the pecan / breadcrumb mixture , have a roasting pan that has been sprayed with vegetable oil. dredge the tenderloins through the flour until coated , then dip in the egg mixture , roll in the pecan / breadcrumb mixture and place in the roasting pan. this is really messy , so much so that i almost invariably wash my hands between tenderloins. dont worry too much about how this looks , but be sure that the tenderloin is pretty much covered with the pecan / breadcrumb mixture. spray the exposed parts of the roast with a little vegetable oil. this will help crisp up the crust while baking. bake in a 425 or 450 degree oven until the internal temperature is about 160 degrees. we do use a meat thermometer when we make this recipe. usually 25-35 minutes ,. remove from oven and let sit for about 10 minutes. meanwhile , in a sauce pan combine equal parts of heavy cream and the same mustard you combined with the egg whites. heat this mixture stove top until it thickens a bit. slice the tenderloins , trying to keep as much of the crust on the meat as possible. some will come off. dont worry about it. if you are serving family style , lay the pieces on a platter and then drizzle the sauce over pieces. if you are serving restaurant style , place 1-3 pieces on a plate , drizzle sauce over the pieces , and then around them.
