mix all ingredients together in small saucepan over med. heat , being careful not to burn. bring to a boil. use 2 parts cornstarch to 1 part water , mixed together to thicken the above sauce. if you want to thicken further , mix another 2 parts cornstarch to 1 part water together and add to the mixture , until you achieve the thickness of your choice. if too thick , thin mixture with a little orange juice or water. i don't know how many this serves. i just guessed. it should be enough to pour over 3 or 4 pieces of chicken , or fish.
