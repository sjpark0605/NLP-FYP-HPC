boil 5 cups of water in tea kettle , then transfer boiling water to saucepan. add sugar , mix till disolved. add teabags , and mint , and bring back to boil. take off burner , and let tea bags and mint steep for 7-10 minutes , depending upon how strong you like your tea. discard tea bags and mint. add lemon juice and stir well. add ice cubes , and they will begin melting right away. stir , then pour contents into juice jug - ice cubes don't have to finish melting , they will do so in the jug. chill well. if you are in a hurry , serve over several ice cubes in a glass. the flavor is quite different when adding the mint , so try it both ways to see which way you prefer it.
