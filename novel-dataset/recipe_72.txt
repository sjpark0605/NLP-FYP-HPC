wash chicken and pat dry. brown in the 2 tbsp. of oil and drain on paper towel. grease a 1 1 / 2 qt. casserole dish. layer sliced potatoes on the bottom , the chopped onion next. pour soup over all. place chicken breast on top , sprinkle with paprika. cover tightly with tinfoil and bake in a preheated 350 oven for 1 hour. this is the original recipe. when i made it , i used cream of chicken soup because we don't like mushroom. i also used bite sized pieces of stir fried chicken , but still cooked it for an hour. i guess because it's covered in foil , it didn't dry out. was good enough for all 3 of us to like it !. lol this would be a very easy recipe to double or triple !.
