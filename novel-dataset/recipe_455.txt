pour apple juice into a microwave-safe mug , add spices , and nuke at full power for 1 1 / 2 minutes or until it is hot , yet drinkable. remove from the microwave and steep the tea bag for as long as you like. i like a mild tea flavour so i just swish it around for about 15 seconds. remove tea bag and drink immediately !.
