cut pumpkin in half , remove seeds and as much of the "stringy stuff" as you can , and chop into pieces approximately 1-1. 5 inches by 1. 5-2. 5 inches. slice off skin , taking off as little flesh as you can. measure to make sure you have approximately one quart of pumpkin pieces. put in a fairly heavy saucepan and cover with water. cover , bring to a boil , and boil for 15-20 minutes. drain , but save water , and place pumpkin back in pan. measure water to make sure you have about 1 1 / 2 cups. stir in packed brown sugar until smooth. add cloves and / or cinnamon at this point , if desired. pour the sugar / water syrup over the pumpkin , cover , return to a boil , and boil another 15 minutes. turn off heat and let sit overnight this is how the pumpkin soaks up the syrup and "candies". in the morning , return to a boil , and boil an additional 5 minutes. remove from syrup with a slotted spoon and place on a tray or cookie sheet lined with waxed paper. allow to dry at least 10-12 hours in a place where it will not be disturbed. roll in granulated sugar and enjoy ! place in air-tight container to store up to two weeks.
