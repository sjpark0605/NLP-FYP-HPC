place frozen bananas in a food processor and puree , adding the vanilla extract and just a few spoonfuls of juice or milk to make a soft serve texture to the banana"ice cream". serve just like ice-- in a cone , in a stemmed parfait glass layered with strawberries , or as a sundae with chocolate syrup. you can also flavor the"ice cream" with other frozen fruit that you puree together with the bananas. pineapple is especially delicious , and mango is wonderful. for vegan do not use the milk. use the fruit juice.
