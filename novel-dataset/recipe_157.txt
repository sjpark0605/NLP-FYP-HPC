scald the milk , and cool to lukewarm , not too hot , or it will kill the yeast. mix flour , yeast , oil and milk in a medium bowl , cover and let rest for 20 minutes. sprinkle on salt and mix dough in an electric mixer with dough hook on low medium speed , adding flour as needed until it is sticky and stretchy , and comes away from the sides of the bowl. let dough rest , covered , 30 minutes , knead again for about 5 minutes. the dough should be very sticky , but hold together in a ball. rinse and drain artichoke hearts , and finely chop. mix artichokes , tomatoes , and cheese , set aside. the tomatoes will absorb any excess moisture from artichokes and soften nicely. let the dough rise until doubled , about 1 1 / 2 to 2 hours. scrape out onto a floured countertop or large cutting board. shape the dough into a rough rectangle. roll with a floured rolling pin to about 1 / 4 to 1 / 2 inch thick. top roughly 2 / 3 of the dough with cheese , tomatoes , and artichokes , the mixture should be damp , but not dripping wet. fold dough into thirds , like an envelope , with the empty third over the center , and the other side over that , and roll again gently , until the fillings just begin to be visible through the top of the dough. place dough on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper or silpat. preheat oven to 450f. let dough rise , loosely covered , 1 to 1 1 / 2 hours , until puffy and soft. brush dough with olive oil. use fingers to make several small dimples in bread. sprinkle with kosher salt , and more cheese if you like. bake for 15 minutes , rotating pan after 10 minutes. let cool slightly before cutting into squares.
