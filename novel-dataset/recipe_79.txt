start steaming the rice , i usually use around 3 cups depending on how many and how much you like rice. if you dont have a rice cooker you can pick up a couple of to go orders from any asian restaraunt. while its steaming make sure theres no bones in the filet and cut the larger filet into proper sized filet's for adults or children. use a little bit of oil in the pan and heat pan to med. i cant give exact times because every stove is different but i cook it on both sides for a couple minutes. season both sides in the pan with the salt an pepper. if you have pappys seasoning thats the best. right here you can also squeeze the lemon over the cooking fish or over the prepared dish later if you please. while its cooking you can dice up the mango and avocado into small uniform pieces. keep in a bowl. right around now the fish should be done so lay a bed of organic baby greens on the plates. spread an even layer of rice on the plate keeping the greens visible by a quarter inch on the outside. lay the mango avocado medley on top of the rice then a filet on top of that. if you want you can garnish with some fresh cilantro. also its really healthy as it is but you can add soy sauce over it all for taste. bon appetit.
