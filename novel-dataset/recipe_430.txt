base -- in a medium to large heavy pot , add the olive oil and bring to medium high heat. season the chicken and pork well with salt and pepper and then add to the pot along with the sausage. cook 3-4 minutes until it starts to brown , you want it to get a little crust. then add in the onion , garlic , celery and reduce heat to medium. stir well to combine all the flavors and cook just another minute or two. wine and broth -- deglaze the pan with the wine scraping up all the bits on the bottom. then , mix the tomato paste with the chicken broth and add that as well and stir to combine. beans -- add the beans , thyme , celery leaves , and bay leaf. check for seasoning and add salt and pepper if necessary. cover and continue to cook on medium low for 15 to 20 minutes. check if you want any extra broth. this would be the time to add it. this is a very hearty thick cassoulet which is different from other recipes. but add more broth if you want. bread crumbs -- as the main dish cooks , add the oil to a small sauce pan along with the fresh bread crumbs and saute until golden brown on medium heat. it only takes a minute or two. remove and let cool. after it cools slightly , mix with the fresh chopped parsley. this is your garnish. serve -- just dish up and top with the bread crumb and parsley garnish. then drizzle olive oil over the top. enjoy !.
