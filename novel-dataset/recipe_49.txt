add soy sauce , serrano chilis , onion , garlic , salt , pepper , & turmeric powder in the blender or food processor. grind it up into a paste for about one minute. pour the paste in a large mixing bowl. add the ground beef to the paste and mix it in as thoroughly and evenly as possible. the meat will take on a brown color from the paste mix. turn on the electric grill and let it heat up for about five minutes. while it is heating , take the meat and roll out little sausages. 1 lb of beef should make about one dozen little tikka sausages. when the grill is preheated and ready , place the tikka sausages on it. let it cook on the grill for about 7 minutes or long enough for the tikka to cook completely. place the tikka in a casserole dish with a lid to keep it hot , or serve it immediately. use the cup of yogurt as a dip for the tikka. toasted bread , roti , or any flat bread goes well with tikka. you can use not only yogurt , but ketchup and other dressings as dipping sauces.
