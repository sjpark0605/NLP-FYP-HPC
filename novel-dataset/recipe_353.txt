cut bread into square quarters. place about 3 / 4 tsp of jam in the centre of the quarter of bread and fold bread over. seal the bread shut with a little beaten egg and coat the outside with a little egg as well. make sure the bread stays folded over by poking a skewer through the top corner. using the skewer , hold the doughnut over the embers of the fire until the egg is cooked and the bread stays stuck together. eat - remembering that it's full of hot jam :-). make as many as you have ingredients for.
