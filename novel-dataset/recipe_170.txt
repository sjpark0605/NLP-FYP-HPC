using 3 bowls:. combine apples and sugar. combine dry ingredients except raisins and walnuts. combine liquid. mix liquids and apples. combine with dry ingredients to moisten. add walnuts and raisins. bake 25 minutes at 350. i've just made them recently and if all the quantities are included and not overbaked , the apples alone make this moist and almost sticky. so i hope some will give this recipe a try.
